# The-Towers-of-Hanoi
This is a c-program to demonstrate the well known children games-'The towers of Hanoi'.

The Towers of Hanoi is a well-known children's game, played with three poles and a number of different-sized disks. Each disk has a hole in the center, allowing it to be stacked around any of the poles. Initially, the disks are stacked on the leftmost pole in the order of decreasing size, i.e., the largest on the bottom and the smallest on the top.

The object of the game is to transfer the disks from the leftmost pole to the rightmost pole, without ever placing a 
larger disk on top of a smaller disk. Only one disk may be moved at a time, and each disk must always be placed around 
one of the poles.
